/*! This macro is used to log human readable information within a
  registered class.  It can only be used within the scope of a method
  part of a class registered in the cmnClassRegister using the macros
  #CMN_DECLARE_SERVICES and #CMN_IMPLEMENT_SERVICES declared in
  cmnClassRegister.h.  For a non registered class of a global
  function, please use #CMN_LOG.

  The message is streamed along with a Level of Detail to cmnLogger
  provided that two conditions are met:

  - The level of detail associated to the message must be lower or
    equal to the level of detail used to filter the messages at the
    global level.  This global level of detail is set via the
    cmnLogger.

  - The level of detail associated to the message must be lower or
    equal to the level of detail used to filter the messages by the
    class itself.  To modify the class specific level of detail, see
    cmnClassServicesBase and cmnClassRegister

  The macro creates an output stream if the level of detail of the
  message satisfies the two criteria defined above.  It can be used as
  any other output stream:

  \code
  CMN_LOG_CLASS(4) << "This is a message of LoD 4" << this->x << std::endl;
  \endcode

  \param lod The log level of detail of the message.

  message was generated.

  For example:
  \code
  CMN_LOG(1) << CMN_LOG_DETAILS << "Error occurs" << std::endl;

  For any error with a very common message, this helps the programmer

/*!  \brief Class to glue the class register, the output multiplexer
  and the message level of detail to form the logging entity of cisst.

  \ingroup cisstCommon

  cmnLogger is defined as a singleton, i.e. there is only one instance
  of cmnLogger.  This unique object maintains the data required for
  the cisst logging system.  The desing of the logging system
  relies on:

  - Human readable messages are associated to a Level of Detail.

  - The messages are sent and filtered based on their level of detail.
    The macros used to send the messages actually check if the message
    is to be sent or not before creating them in order to improve
    performances (see #CMN_LOG_CLASS and #CMN_LOG).

  - The messages are sent to a multiplexer owned by cmnLogger.  This
    multiplexer allows to send the message (along with their level of
    detail) to multiple output streams.

  To filter the messages, the user can use:

  - The global level of detail defined in cmnLogger.  Any message with
    a level of detail greater than the global level of detail will be
    ignored (at minimal execution time cost).  This level of detail is
    used by #CMN_LOG_CLASS and #CMN_LOG.  To modify the global level
    of detail, use cmnLogger::SetLoD(newLoD).

  - Each class defines a level of detail.  This allows to tune the log
    based on the user's needs.  One can for example allow all the
    messages (from errors to warnings) from a given class and block
    all the messages from every other class.  As for the global level
    of detail, if a message's level of detail is greater than the
    class level of detail, it will be ignored (at minimal execution
    time cost).  This level of detail is used only be #CMN_LOG_CLASS.
    To modify a class level of detail, use either the class register
    with cmnClassRegister::SetLoD("className", newLoD) or the class
    services with object.Services()->SetLoD(newLoD).

  - The output streams level of details.  Each output stream has its
    own level of detail and will stream only the messages with a level
    of details lesser or equal to his.  This allows for example to log
    everything to a file while printing only the high priority ones to
    std::cout.  To set the level of detail of an output stream, use
    cmnLogger::GetMultiplexer()->AddChannel(newStream, newLoD).

  \sa cmnClassRegister cmnClassServicesBase cmnLODOutputMultiplexer 
*/
class CISST_EXPORT cmnLogger {

 public:
    /*! Type used to define the logging level of detail. */
    typedef short LoDType;

 private:
    /*! Global Level of Detail used to filter all messages.

      As for the signification of the different level of details, they
      depend on each class implementation.  Nevertheless, it's
      recommended to use some values between 0 and 10, 10 being the
      highest level of detail which corresponds to the maximum amount
      of logging.  Also, for the programmers of new classes, we
      recommend the following levels:

      - 1: Errors during the initialization.
      - 2: Warnings during the initialization.
      - 3 and 4: Extra messages during the initialization.
      - 5: Errors during normal operations (also defined as #CMN_LOG_DEFAULT_LOD).
      - 6: Warnings during normal operations.
      - 7 and above: Verbose to very verbose.

      The idea is that for most classes, important errors happens
      during the initialization (constructor, opening a serial port,
      configuring some hardware device, open a grapical context, etc.)
      and during the normal operations, time can become critical.
      Therefore a level 5 would log a lot of information at the
      beginning and only the critical messages during the normal
      operations.
