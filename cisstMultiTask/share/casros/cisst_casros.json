//
// This file defines a set of cisst-specific framework events and filters for casros.
// All task-type cisst components in the system will have events and filters that
// this file defines.
// The names of target components are null because they will be replaced by casros later 
// with actual names when casros processes this file.
//
// There is another specification file that defines filters and events that are not
// dependent on a particular component-based framework.  This includes filters for
// thread exception detection, thread overrun detection, and error propagation.
// This file can be accessed in the casros library folder, or in the following URL:
//
// https://github.com/minyang/casros/blob/master/libs/fdd/filters/json/framework_filters.json
